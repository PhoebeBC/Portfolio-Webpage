						<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, GitPages</li>
							<li>Showcasing relevant	information for potential collaborations or employment
								opportunities. I acquired my skills by completing sections of a course and studying
								the structures of other	personal websites, without following a step-by-step tutorial.
							</li>
							<li>
								When encountering challenges, I researched online for solutions and employed them
								successfully. Creating a colour scheme posed a challenge, as aesthetic design is
								completely new for me. The most	enjoyable part was crafting interactive elements to
								liven up the website.
							</li>
							<li>Prior to deployment, I ensured the design worked well on various screen sizes and had a
								friend in software review my code for cleanliness and accuracy.

						<h3>Storm Website</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>React, Python, Django, AWS, Database Management</li>
							<li>I play for the Storm summer league mixed hockey team, where match details and player
								availability are currently managed through multiple Google Sheets. Recognizing the
								opportunity to enhance our system, I am developing a fully functional website to
								learn full-stack development.
							</li>
							<li>Collaborating with a teammate who specializes in
								front-end development, we will work closely with the Storm team captains and
								organizers to ensure the website meets all necessary requirements.
							</li>
							<li>The website
								will be optimized for mobile devices, and the initial release will enable players
								to log in, access match details, and indicate their availability for specific matches.

						<h3>Ceaser Cypher</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>I developed a script capable of encrypting a message from a text file using a
								Caesar cipher and generating another text file with the encrypted message.
							</li>
							<li>Subsequently, I enhanced the complexity of the encryption process. Rather than all
								characters sharing the same shift, each succeeding character experienced a shift
								of n+1, where n represents the shift of the preceding character.
							</li>
							<li>Lastly, to maintain
								code efficiency, I implemented the reverse encryption using the same function by
								modifying a single parameter.

					<h3>Server Client Chat</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Implemented a class to establish a socket connection on both the client and
									server sides, enabling seamless message exchange via TCP between the two once the
									code is executed.
								</li>
								<li>
									This project improved my understanding of ports, IP addresses,
									sockets and endpoints.

					<h3>Leet Code</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Engaging in LeetCode problems of varying difficulty levels has helped to
									sharpen my coding skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms, enabling
									the enhancing of my code efficiency. </li>
								<li>This ongoing commitment serves as a
									continuous effort to refine my coding proficiency,
									and I intend to extend this practice to any new language I undertake.</li>

					<h3>Recipie Book App</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>React native, Python, Database Management, Swift/Kotlin</li>
								<li>The application facilitates users in capturing images of recipes, extracting
									and storing their contents within the app. Users can enhance organization by
									adding tags, such as: Starter, Meat dish, Under 15 minutes, Meal Prep,
									thereby simplifying the retrieval of recipes.
								</li>

								<li>In instances where the desired content is unavailable on the UK service
									but accessible on the Australian service, users can leverage a VPN to access
									and stream the show.
