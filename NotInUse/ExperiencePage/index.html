						<h3>Dashboard Building</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Utilized Python, Flask, and APIs to construct a comprehensive web application
								dedicated to reporting vital company statistics. The application comprised multiple
								pages of dynamic information requiring real-time updates at regular intervals.
							</li>
							<li>Integrated SQL and a Postgres database to embed queries in the backend Python script,
								ensuring that page refreshes triggered the execution of queries, subsequently
								updating the data.
							</li>
							<li>Consulted senior colleagues for essential metrics to include on the dashboard and
								maintained good version control practices by using GitHub and requiring pull requests
								to main to be reviewed before merging.
							</li>
							<li>Employed Highcharts within the backend to present key metrics through interactive
								diagrams and graphs. Structured and customized the website using HTML with Jinja
								and CSS with Bootstrap for enhanced design and aesthetics.

						<h3>Acceptance and Regression Testing Automation</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Upon the implementation of decision changes in the testing environments, I
								manually submitted and reviewed multiple applications for potential code errors
								prior to deployment. Utilizing Jira dashboards, change requests were tracked and
								updated, with reported fixes documented within the corresponding Jira tickets.
							</li>
							<li>The time sink which QA had become, led me to explore the capabilities of Selenium and
								subsequently apply the framework with Python allow full automation of
								application testing. This initiative resulted in significant time savings, up to
								six hours per change.
							</li>
							<li>The success of automating tasks in our team inspired collaboration with a junior
								colleague to extend automation efforts across various tasks within our team and
								the operations department, streamlining processes company-wide.
